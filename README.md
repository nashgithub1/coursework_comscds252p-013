### Programming for Data Science Coursework

This repository contains my complete coursework for the MSc Data Science module at Coventry University. The project is divided into three main components covering Object-Oriented Programming, Data Analysis, and AI Ethics.

###  Project Structure

* **question1_university_system/**
  Implementation of a University Management System using OOP concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Includes classes for Person, Student, Faculty, Staff, Course, and Department.

* **question2_data_analysis/**
  E-commerce data analysis using web scraping from *Books to Scrape*. Covers data collection, cleaning, statistical analysis, visualization, and a regression model for price prediction.

* **question3_ethics/**
  A detailed report on AI ethics in healthcare, focusing on data privacy, algorithmic bias, and stakeholder impact.

* **technical_report.pdf**
  Comprehensive report explaining methodology, findings, challenges, and reflections.

* **requirements.txt**
  List of dependencies required to run the project.

###  Key Features

* Web scraping using `BeautifulSoup`
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Statistical and exploratory data analysis
* Data visualization with Matplotlib
* Machine learning using Linear Regression
* OOP-based system design
* Ethical analysis of AI in healthcare

###  Notes

* Data collection was refined to include book categories for better analysis
* Extensive preprocessing was done to handle special characters and inconsistent data
* AI tools and online resources were used for debugging and model development
